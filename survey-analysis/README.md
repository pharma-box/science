[Markdown as code](./scrubb-data.md)

## Development

The easiest way to get started is to run the `Makefile`. Available commands can be seen by typing `make` in the current directory `/science/survey-analysis`. You need to have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [CMake](https://cmake.org/) installed. `CMake` should be installed by default if you are using a `*.nix` operating system.

**Available Commands**:

1. `install` ....... installs all the required dependencies using pip

2. `start` ....... starts all notebooks

3. `list` ....... list active notebooks

4. `down` ....... shutdown notebooks on 8888
